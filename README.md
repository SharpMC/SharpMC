What is SharpMC?
----------------
SharpMC is a Minecraft server written in C# made by Kennyvv.
It is a hobby project, the goal is to create an alternative to Spigot/Bukkit/Sponge.
Recently BuddyTex joined me, so please welcome him to the team! :)

Will this be an alternative to Spigot/Bukkit/Sponge?
-------------------------------------------------------
I must honestly say, i doubt it. It is a hobby project, i don't have the time to work on it that much.
However, it is my goal! But you have to understand that i'm on my own working on this so it might take some time...
